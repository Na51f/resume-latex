% Salutation
Dear Hiring Team,\\

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Jr Full Stack .NET / Web Developer contract position at Compass Digital Labs. My background in full-stack development, including designing web applications, RESTful APIs (integrated with Power Apps/Automate), and managing SQL databases, aligns well with your requirements. I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, Python, Azure, and Docker.\\

While my recent professional work focused on Python/JavaScript stacks, my Computer Engineering degree and C\# tutoring experience provide a strong foundation. I am a rapid learner, adept at mastering new technologies, and eager to apply my skills within the .NET framework and SQL Server environment at Compass Digital. I am also excited to learn tools like Amazon Q, Copilot, and SonarQube.\\

My experience includes collaborating within Agile teams, supporting end-users, and demonstrating strong problem-solving and communication skills. The opportunity at Compass Digital Labs, particularly the contract-to-hire aspect, is very appealing.\\

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume and welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to your team.\\\\
% Closing
\noindent Sincerely,\\
\colorbox{sky800}{\textcolor{white}{\large\textbf{Nasif Mauthoor}}}
